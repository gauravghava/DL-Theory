It maps the input to an output between 0 and 1, which is useful for binary classification problems where the output represents the probability of belonging to a particular class. The sigmoid function has a smooth transition from 0 to 1, but its outputs are not zero-centered, which can make training more difficult.\n",

Like the sigmoid function, the tanh function has a smooth transition from -1 to 1, but it is zero-centered, which can make optimization easier.\n",

It maps negative inputs to 0 and positive inputs to the same value, creating a piecewise linear function. ReLU is popular due to its simplicity and ability to avoid the vanishing gradient problem that can occur with activation functions such as sigmoid and tanh. It also has a fast computation time as it only involves a simple comparison and multiplication operation.\n",

This helps to address the issue of the ReLU activation function completely saturating the gradient for negative inputs.\n",

        "    - Softmax: The softmax activation function is used in the output layer of multi-class classification problems to produce a probability distribution over the classes. It maps the input to a set of values that sum up to 1, so that the outputs can be interpreted as class probabilities.

A larger learning rate results in faster convergence, but it is more likely to overshoot the optimal solution and get stuck in a suboptimal solution.
