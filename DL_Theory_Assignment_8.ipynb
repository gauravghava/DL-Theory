        "\n",
        "    1. Better handling of input sequences: Encoder-Decoder RNNs use an encoder RNN to process the input sequence and produce a compact, fixed-length vector representation, which is then fed into a decoder RNN to produce the output sequence. This allows the encoder RNN to process longer input sequences and capture more information about the source language, as compared to a plain Seq2Seq RNN, which may struggle to handle long input sequences.\n",
        "\n",
        "    2. Improved modeling of the target sequence: The decoder RNN in an Encoder-Decoder RNN is trained to generate the target sequence from the fixed-length vector representation produced by the encoder RNN. This allows the decoder RNN to focus on modeling the target language, and eliminates the need to learn to model both the source and target languages in a single network, as in a plain Seq2Seq RNN.\n",
        "\n",
        "    3. Better handling of different sequence lengths: Encoder-Decoder RNNs allow you to handle input sequences of different lengths by encoding each sequence into a fixed-length vector representation, which eliminates the need to pad the sequences to a fixed length, as in a plain Seq2Seq RNN.\n",

For example, you can pad all input sequences to the length of the longest sequence in the batch. However, this method can result in a large number of padding tokens in the input sequence, which can affect the model's performance.\n",

        "\n",
        "    3. Bucketing: You can also group sequences into different buckets based on their length, and then pad or truncate sequences within each bucket to a fixed length. This allows you to handle variable-length sequences more efficiently and reduces the impact of padding or truncation.\n",
        "\n",
        "    4. Dynamic RNNs: Another approach is to use dynamic RNNs, which can handle variable-length input sequences dynamically by using the length of the input sequence to unroll the RNN. This eliminates the need for padding or truncation, but may be more computationally expensive than static RNNs.\n",

The model is then trained to predict the next token in the sequence until it generates the end-of-sequence token. Another approach is to use teacher forcing, where the model is trained using the true target sequences rather than its own predictions. This can help the model generate more accurate target sequences, but may also make the model more dependent on the teacher forcing."

The basic idea behind beam search is to maintain a set of K hypotheses (or \"beams\") at each time step, where K is a user-defined parameter that determines the number of beams to maintain. At each time step, the algorithm generates the next token for each hypothesis, computes the probability of each generated sequence, and selects the K most likely sequences to continue as beams for the next time step. This process continues until the end of the sequence is reached, and the algorithm selects the beam with the highest probability as the final output.\n",
